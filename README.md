# Astronomy Labs
These are a collection of lab worksheets that I put together / modified as a teaching assistant. Some of the original worksheets can be found in [TA_Lab_Manuals.pdf](./TA_Lab_Manuals.pdf).

See [EPLS_7385.pdf](./EPLS_7385.pdf) to read my Pedagogical Content Knowledge paper that I wrote as part of the course Teaching and Learning in Higher Education (EPLS:7385).

## Websites
Below are some links to content that I developed with an explanation of each.

### [Planetary Data](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~bergerud/ASTR/Plots/planets.html)
An interactive Chart.js application showing properties of the planets in our solar system. Used in the Active Learning lab.

### [Quasar Data](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~bergerud/ASTR/Plots/Quasar/quasar.html)
An interactive D3 application showing the quasar spectra for the Redshift lab. Wavelengths have been converted to nanometers.
